# mantra docs

Notes on the parts of this app whose behaviour is not recoverable by reading the
code alone — where the reasoning lives in a protocol, a failure mode that is
silent, or a decision that looked arbitrary and was not.

| document | covers |
|---|---|
| [shared-key-ceremony.md](./shared-key-ceremony.md) | ChillDKG over NIP-17: the rounds, the approval gates, the chat transcript, participant ordering |
| [shared-key-derivation.md](./shared-key-derivation.md) | deriving further keys from the group's threshold key with FROST tweaks — why not BIP32, why no chain code, and the one rule that must not be broken |
| [marmot-membership.md](./marmot-membership.md) | how members join an MLS group, and the epoch race that makes a missing member look like a successful invite |
| [long-running-sync.md](./long-running-sync.md) | the chat subscriptions that stay open instead of pulling once per screen — why the request queue could not simply hold one, and how the group filter follows the room list |
| [dead-code.md](./dead-code.md) | code in the sync and relay stack that nothing calls, why each piece is still there, and which of it is a bug rather than a leftover |

Start with the ceremony if you are new to this area; the next two both assume it.
The last two stand alone, and the dead-code inventory reads as a follow-up to the
sync note.
